# What should I write on?

For a long time, I have thought of having a blog where I would be able to communicate my thoughts and share valuable information to whoever needs it. 

Finally I have started, well at at least the foundation of the website is up and now the aspect of writing is what I am deciding on now. The options are to write on 
my research field or 
on science in general or 
on how to find valubale information. 
All these are challenging in doing when starting off. 

I am passionate visualising information for easy digestion by everyone hence I would have a whole section dedicated to publishing inforgraphics.
